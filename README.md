# Titanic-Machine-Learning-Competition

## Overview
This repository contains the code for the Titanic Machine Learning competition on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features like age, sex, ticket class, etc.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Dataset
The competition dataset consists of two CSV files: 'train.csv' and 'test.csv', containing the training and test data, respectively. The 'train.csv' file contains the target variable 'Survived', which indicates whether a passenger survived (1) or not (0).

## Code Structure
- `titanic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `submission.csv`: The submission file generated by the code, which contains the predictions for the test data to be submitted to Kaggle.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 and the required libraries installed.
3. Download the Titanic dataset from the Kaggle competition page and place the files 'train.csv' and 'test.csv' in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Open the `titanic.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
5. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code step by step.
6. The final predictions will be saved in the `submission.csv` file.

## Model and Hyperparameter Tuning
In this code, we use the RandomForestClassifier for model training. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to find the best combination of hyperparameters. Cross-validation is used to evaluate the model's performance.
